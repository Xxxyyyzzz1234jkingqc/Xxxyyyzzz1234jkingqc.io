First description 
<br> A group effort, undetaken in GES 400, pertaining to a storymap that plotted how the Batimore Uprising has impacted residents, and how it has otherwise worsened/strengthened the existing social, racial, and economic tensions within Baltimore City. <br>
Second description 
<br> Though imperfect, and relatively simplistic, we found the undetaking a relatively translatable way to highlight the trends dominating some neighborhoods in the city, and saw our medium as most-understandable for the people who actually live in these neighbrhoods, without overwhelming, nor babying them to our findings. <br>
